I'm excited to share with you a simple calculator project I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It only took me about 25 minutes to put together, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts and feedback on it.

Creating this calculator was a fun exercise in combining different web technologies to produce a functional tool. While it may be basic, it serves as a great starting point for further exploration and enhancement.

Feel free to take a look at the project and let me know what you think. Your input is highly appreciated!

Thank you for your time.
